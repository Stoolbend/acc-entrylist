# ACC Toolkit

>ACC Toolkit is a collection of useful tools for preparing configuration files for Assetto Corsa Competizione servers.


## âœ¨ Coming soon...

This is the new version using Vue 3 which is currently in progress. It will eventually replace the old Vue 2 version that lives in the `main` branch.
The new version will (hopefully) include all the features from the current website as well as new things like the ability to save drivers & supporting multiple platforms.

Please let me know if you have any feedback using the issues tracker here on GitHub. ðŸ˜Ž

## Contributing

Anyone is welcome to contribute to the project

ACC Toolkit is developed using the Vue.js 3 framework. It also uses [BootstrapVueNext](https://github.com/bootstrap-vue-next/bootstrap-vue-next) to wrap Bootstrap 5 components as well as [VueFinalModal](https://github.com/vue-final/vue-final-modal) for managing modals.

Dependencies are managed using pnpm (instead of npm). If you've not used it before then [here is the getting started guide](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-npm).

### Project setup

```bash
# install dependencies
pnpm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
pnpm dev

# build for production
pnpm build
```
